</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I’m sure it’s common knowledge that <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019</em> was something of a disappointing release. It was brought out with all the pomp and fanfare, all the obligatory hype, of any of the instalments in the venerable <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> series, and thus, like many Call of Duty titles before it, could never live up to the expectations pressed upon it by an unforgiving public, drawn in by all the marketing and brand recognition that makes Activision's hit game series as popular as it is, and thus <em>Modern Warfare 2019</em> now finds itself regarded as something of a mediocre game.</p>
<p>One cannot envy its position, of course. <em>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</em> is generally considered to be one of the best FPSs ever made, and certainly one of the best Call of Duty games, and Infinity Ward’s 2019 release has only one digit different in the title. When drawn up against such a high bar, especially one whose upper limits are clouded by the rosy fog of nostalgia, <em>Modern Warfare 2019</em> was simply set up to fail, and, excepting an exceptional title, was never going to be the resounding success Activision might have hoped. What we got was a solid, if unexceptional, new instalment in a long running series. </p>
<p>While, overall, the game can be described as “solid”, “fine” and “enjoyable”, primarily thanks to the satisfying and cathartic weapons (both in sound and visuals), one cannot deny that it is plagued with problems. For one, the multiplayer has been completely unbalanced since release, and this issue has never quite been resolved, despite a multitude of 200MB balance patches, and much moaning on the part of the community. This ineffectual balancing is epitomised by the M4, which, on release, was absurdly overpowered and by far the strongest weapon in the game, and, even after three nerfs, was still top tier. Only the addition of the even stronger (at range) Grau 556 forced it out of the Warzone meta, and it remains very strong in normal matches to this day. Similarly, the MP5 has long been by far the best SMG, capable up close and at range thanks to a 10mm Auto conversion kit. Only a recent patch has brought down this build, only for it to be replaced by the Uzi’s 41AE rounds, which catapulted the Uzi from the worst weapon in the game to extremely strong, for nothing but a single attachment slot. It is telling, and a serious black mark against the game’s balancing, that the esports scene has banned out a huge number of items from competitive events, just to keep fights fair and interesting. </p>
<p>The single player fairs better. While it cannot compare to the masterpiece that it Call of Duty 4’s <em>All Ghillied Up</em>, there is a decent variety of missions, a solid, if somewhat unbelievable, overarching plot, and some, <strong>some</strong>, good gameplay segments. <em>Clean House</em> springs to mind as probably the best mission in the game, where you form part of a crack squad, night vision on, crawling through a house full of terrorists, breaching rooms, and having to make tense snap decisions on whether to shoot or hold fire, quickly deducing whether you are staring at a non-combatant, or an armed terrorist and, sometimes, the right answer is far from clear. This was probably the high point of the game – tense, exciting, short, it epitomises what a Call of Duty mission should be. Another enjoyable, and more unique mission, comes in <em>Highway of Death</em>, as you use a custom sniper rifle to rain down fire upon a convoy, necessitating careful, called shots, and precision shooting at long range. The little minigame that is the sniping was rather enjoyable – if anything the segment was too short. </p>
<p>Of course, these good experiences find themselves offset by some real stinkers, with some missions suffering from rather tasteless premises and/or executions, and others simply from bad, repetitive and boring gameplay. <em>Embassy</em> steps forward as the ambassador of poor gameplay, with the segment where you have to guide someone through a building full of troops without being seen, using cameras and pre-set movement points, being overly hard, overly long, and completely boring. The camera angles are frustrating and the movement mechanics even more so, the segment takes multiple attempts to finish, and it utterly uninteresting – if she didn’t allow you to get to the next fun bit, you might even wish the civilian dead. Alas, any hope that the next part would be exciting is thwarted, as you are forced into the use of a laser pointer to call in drone strikes, against buildings and APCs. Compared the gunplay, which is cathartic, with guns feeling extremely good to shoot, the laser pointer gets old fast, and you have to use it for a long time, far too long after the novelty has worn off.</p>
<p>Representing tastelessness comes to the segments where you have to play as a young child, and yet still merrily murder Russian soldiers with knives, screwdrivers and stolen revolvers (complete with recoil that rather comically knock you over), and the waterboarding minigame – an astoundingly stupid and horrifically tasteless idea. Call of Duty games are about violence, and I’m cool with that, but a minigame to avoid torture and children <strong>stone cold icing Russians with knives and screwdrivers</strong> is somewhat a step over the line. </p>
<p>The biggest issue of all, though, is the horrible optimisation on the PC version. Despite more than sufficient hardware it is not unknown for the game to freeze up and crash without warning, the bug randomly retuning and disappearing with each update. One friend suffers overheating and BSODs for seemingly no reason, and stuttering, lag and long loading times are common, something that is, quite frankly, unacceptable in a modern AAA release, especially one that costs £59.99. Either make your game work on PC, or make it a console exclusive. You can’t get the PC crowd to buy your game, but also put in no effort to make it work on their platform. The polish is horrendous, and it has, many a time, come close to making me stop playing the game all together. Indeed, I took a month-long hiatus simply to wait for the freeze-crash issue to be resolved, only to find that it was still very much there. This issue, I’m sure, has pushed many players away from the game. And many of these teething issues are still, six months or so after release, waiting to be resolved. </p>
<p>Of course, the real question is this – what was this whole rant leading up to? Despite all of the game’s problems, despite all of the issue I may have with it, the game does have one redeeming factor. The single player is, on balance, mediocre, the multiplayer OK, but bores quickly, the Co Op sometimes enjoyable (in an action movie sort of way), sometimes dull and frustrating. However, the game’s Gunfight mode is some of the most fun you can have in a multiplayer game, so long as you have just one person willing to play it with you.</p>
<p>The premise of the Gunfight mode is extremely simple. It is a 2v2 cage fight on small (and sometimes formulaic) yet well put together maps, using random loadouts chosen from the game’s vast number of weapons “blueprints” (pre-set loadouts) along with random utility items. There is a short time limit, after which the round transitions into overtime. A flag appears which teams can then capture to win (the timer to do so is gratifyingly short), else the team with the most health emerges victorious, or, if health is equal, the round ends in a draw. A match of Gunfight is first to six rounds, with weapon switching every two. A typical Gunfight is short, brutal, nail-biting, but, above all, fun. </p>
<p>You can camp at the back of the map, or rush up aggressively. Peek long angles at the beginning, sprint for high ground, or flank your foe. There are several ways to approach each round, and it stays interesting and enjoyable long after the normal multiplayer experience (run at the enemy, spray until one of you dies, rinse and repeat) has grown stale. Another component of the genius of Gunfight is the random weapons, which are the same for both sides, allowing the mode to bypass the balancing issues of the core multiplayer, and ensure every round is a fair fight, as well as keeping gameplay fresh by varying up your gear, forcing you to adapt from round to round, and allowing the use of unviable loadouts and weapons that would get you laughed out of a multiplayer lobby. </p>
<p>The small teams are another great benefit. They allow you to easily ensure that you do not have to rely on random teammates for success, as well as meaning that you can play it often, only needing one friend available to join you. They allow the fights to be quick and brutal, keeping things fast-paced, and ensure there is less of the feeling of racing your teammates for kills that plagues the core modes. Of course, the 2v2 format is also one of the game mode’s downfalls. Often have I bemoaned the random playlists that leave 3v3 gunfight (a rotation mode) unavailable when I have two or more friends online, forcing me to wade into the far less interesting core multiplayer mode, or else host a gunfight 2v2 custom match.  </p>
<p>At the end of the day, for all of its failings, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019</em> remains a fun if unsophisticated and unpolished experience, with Gunfight as a standout, yet under-discussed and underplayed (it can take a good while to find a match) game mode. Gunfight is, as the title may suggest, a diamond in the rough, a hidden gem in an underwhelming release. I would pay a decent some of money ~£20  for a Call of Duty: Gunfight standalone title, so long as it fixed all the bugs and issues with <em>Modern Warfare 2019</em> and was kept up with regular updates for new loadouts to keep variety, and, of course, was able to retain a solid-sized player base. Activision will likely never make such a title (and if they do it’ll probably be a crappy mobile game packed with microtransactions), but, let it be known that, if they did, I would snap it up. Gunfight is one of the best ideas Call of Duty has had in a long time. It is simplistic, basic and easy to do, and yet is one of my most played “games” multiplayer-wise, breathing some fresh air into an otherwise stale formula, and allowing, fun, fast and (the key point the standard multiplayer misses) fair fights, that you can get done in 10 minutes or so, as a cool-down, warm-up or just to sneak in between more important tasks. Frantic, high stakes fights with some of the most cathartic weapons in video games will, likely, never get old. </p>                </article>
