</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Ah yes. <em>Watch Dogs</em>. All the hype, all the enthusiasm, so much that it was simply impossible for the game to live up to all the expectations pressed upon it. So, while the game may have disappointed people in that it was not, as they had anticipated, the Second Coming of Christ, we did get something good out of it. Not the ground-breaking title all had been expecting, but, nonetheless, a fun and enjoyable (if relatively uncomplicated) sandbox, marred by a few small, but nonetheless irritating, niggling issues.</p>
<p><em>Watch Dogs</em> is a (mostly) standard GTA style sandbox, set in a fairly accurate representation of real-life Chicago and the areas immediately surrounding it. Just like most crime sandboxes you can jack cars and gun down civilians as you please, albeit with the danger of (rather hard to dislodge) police pursuits, and the additional expense of lowering your reputation. In terms of a comparison to GTA V, largely considered the best crime sandbox of recent years, the driving is certainly worse, with the physics being both more arcadey and less fun to boot, the braking even more horribly ineffectual, and the camera angles used for motorbikes (particularly when you corner) making them extremely hard to use effectively. Additionally, the player lacks the ability to use guns and throwables while driving, a feature that would help serve to shorten the often-drawn-out car chases, and make them vastly more enjoyable to do as well.  On the other hand, while just as minimalistic, the Watch Dogs HUD is much more useful, and the game has far better combat, with an actually working stealth system, including detection indicators, and fun, yet challenging and skill-based, gunplay, that allows you to use your skill as a player to compensate for recoil – far better than the more luck and stat-based GTA dispersion system. </p>
<p>Of course, as all good AAA titles must, <em>Watch Dogs</em> does have a unique central mechanic, to go along with all the obligatory crime sandbox elements. This is, of course, hacking. In the Watch Dogs universe, Chicago is a so-called “smart city”, meaning that anything and everything electrical is controlled by ctOS, a program that manages the city’s infrastructure, and keeps it all running correctly. Traffic lights, CCTV cameras, bollards, and even moveable bridges all fall under the player’s control, with the player unlocking backdoors into, and thus control over, more and more elements of the city as the game progresses. This provides an ever-increasing degree of control over the city, enabling manipulation the environment to serve the player’s purposes: scouting ahead with cameras, eliminating enemies by overloading fuse boxes/fire hydrants, changing traffic lights and extending bollards to eliminate pursuers, and raising bridges to block the movement of enemies. These mechanics all combine to give the player a major advantage in fights and car chases, as they use the environment of the city to gain the upper hand, adding a more strategical and complex layer to the gameplay. </p>
<p>For all the additional enjoyment and strategy added to the gameplay by the hacking mechanics, and as much as they make the game unique, and not another hacked-out sandbox, they could certainly have been handled better. For example, when being pursued as part of a car chase, it is prudent to lead your enemies through traffic lights and past bollards, as this gives you an opportunity to deal with them. The way in which this is done, however, is little more than a glorified quick-time event, in which a pop-up saying “neutralise” will appear, and, if you press the “hack” key quickly enough, one of your pursuers will be taken out in a hilariously violent crash. This removes a lot of skill and strategy from what could have been a complex mechanic, as, while you can hack bollards and traffic lights whenever you want, it doesn’t actually do much unless the “neutralise” prompt is present. It would be far better if, instead, there had been a way for the player to calculate the optimum time to use these features, rather than the game simply telling them, as it would add vastly more skill and enjoyment to the car chases. </p>
<p>Really, though, the “neutralise” feature is just one example of the game’s biggest flaw – like many Ubisoft titles, <em>Watch Dogs</em> is far too reliant on contextual button prompts. From stealing a car to taking down an enemy, the player lives and dies at the mercy of these button prompts. When participating in a combat mission, it is important to use cameras to scout ahead and mark enemies, as well as trying to get as many environmental kills as possible, by detonating fuse boxes and hacking enemy grenades. However, what you will actually hack by holding down the hack key is only roughly based off of where your crosshair is actually pointing. Several times, in trying to hack a camera that my crosshair was actually pointing at, I’ve accidentally moved the forklift I was hiding behind, exposing myself and leading to my death. Another problem with the button prompts is, occasionally, you have to stand in rather odd places to interact, leading to a little dance around the objective until the prompt appears. This is, after the plot, probably the game’s biggest problem, but it is far from a dealbreaker. </p>
<p>Of course, no look at <em>Watch Dogs</em> would be complete without taking some shots at the plot. The characters are dull, boring, and predictable. Despite being a so-called vigilante, protagonist Aiden Pearce is extremely selfish. Never happy, he has yet to get over the death of his niece, which was his fault, and catching her killer is his sole driving motive throughout the game – making the city a better place is more of a side gig. Even when Nicky, his sister, the mother of the dead child, literally begs him to let it go, he continues fighting and killing for the sole purpose of catching the killer. When old partner Damien Brenks forces him to investigate a lead by capturing Nicky, Aiden uncovers conspiracy and corruption in the Chicago government, assembles a scooby gang of hackers, and eventually deals with those who have wronged him, including saving his sister, and killing Lucky Quinn, the gang boss ultimately responsible for it all, before finally dispatching Damien, and, should the player choose, his niece’s killer as well. Ultimately, the characters are dull and the plot rather complicated, with information getting stolen and stolen back, and all objectives achieved in extremely roundabout and convoluted ways - I had to check a plot overview to make sure I got everything right, despite having played the game. While the player can ultimately choose to have Aiden learn something, he still alienates his family, eventually sending them away forever, and kills civilians, all on his quest for revenge for a death that was mostly his fault. </p>
<p>The biggest issue with the plot however is that, with DedSec (a hacker group that rails against ctOS), the overarching plot and Blume (a security company) the game explores ideas of corrupt officials, blackmail, stolen information, identity theft and constant monitoring of the populace, as well as the issues with centralising all city infrastructure. However, Aiden himself is merely parallel to this – while he does get involved in dealing with the government corruption, as well as helping out DedSec when convenient, he is mainly present for purely selfish reasons, and, while it is looked at, the idea of keeping tabs on everyone in the city, and breaching all of their privacy nonetheless goes criminally unexplored. While the story they went with is, ultimately, fine, a somewhat more noble cause of, say, protecting people’s privacy, could at least have come into things. Such complex ideas are glanced at, but not fully explored and, for the most part, are just there, while the plot focusses on a far more standard and much less interesting revenge story, instead of the complex and relevant themes that we right there, yet only given a passing involvement in the plot. </p>
<p>The game additionally suffers from a number of design oversights and poor choices. For example, I found mission objectives to be rather confusing, in that they often use the phrase “take down the target”. This, at least to me, makes it rather unclear as to whether you can simply shoot the target, or have to deal with them non-lethally – the name of the non-lethal melee attack is, after all “takedown”. However, in many cases, it was acceptable to simply blow the target away – better differentiation between lethal and non-lethal target eliminations would have been a simple but useful feature. I would also have liked the ability to knock out civilians who may otherwise witness you killing ctOS/Blume staff – as it is your only recourse is to shoot them, or let them call the cops – rather annoying when there are a couple of nosey parkers lingering around the entrance to place you are supposed to infiltrate, especially when the reputation system prevents you from simply pulling a supressed gun on them. </p>
<p>So too are other game mechanics simply obtuse or annoying, especially galling when the other core mechanics are so well done. The first such irritating mechanic is the “full-stealth” – some missions forbid you from killing anyone in order to stay fully under the radar, and these grate, when the stealth-action hybrid – a focus on stealth but with the ability to fight your way out should you get spotted – is much more enjoyable. Instant failure on detection simply isn’t fun – giving you a way to extricate yourself from a sticky situation of your own making simply is. While these segments are required by the plot of the mission, it would not take much of a tweak to remove this stipulation. The same applies to the “full-stealth” driving – just not as fun as giving you the opportunity to high-speed escape, especially considering that you do go back into stealth mode after doing so – once again, the option to extricate yourself leads to more enjoyable missions, and it would even be fine if you have to finish in stealth – just don’t have instant failure. It sucks. </p>
<p>The second aforementioned frustrating mechanic is the hacking minigames. They start off painfully simple and end frustratingly complex. While this is, in theory, a good difficulty curve, what it really means is that, at the start, they are too simple to be needed, and just a waste of time, and at the end they take far too long to complete. Maybe an extra mechanic was thought necessary, but I don’t think so, especially considering that little effort has really gone into them, with it effectively being the same puzzle every time, with only slight differences, particularly towards the end of the game, when there are no more additional elements left to introduce. The poor quality of this minigame is even worse when other puzzles, particularly the one in “Hope is a Sad Thing” that requires you to use the profiler, cameras and rotating platforms to find the box that opens a door. It is fun, challenging and complicated, and uses the normal game mechanics, not a poorly implemented cereal-box puzzle.</p>
<p>Yet another of the many stumbling blocks faced by <em>Watch Dogs</em> is the boss fights, although maybe that is too generous of a term, as one of them is simply a quick-time event. The mid-game boss, although it is actually more of a late-game boss, is Mr Iraq and his Super-Enforcer henchman. At the very least, the Iraq fight is an actual boss – the enforcer is extremely tough with a high-damage LMG, requiring the use IEDs to knock him down, then unloading a shotgun into him while he can’t fight back, rinse and repeat. It takes a little while to work out, and is somewhat challenging. Iraq himself has a one-shot-kill automatic shotgun, but is easily dealt with by comparison to the Super-Enforcer (he has far less health) – in my case I panicked, unloaded my semi-auto shotgun into him, and dispatched him rather easily. Nonetheless, the battle is a proper boss fight, and quite fun, seeing as both opponents can kill you in one or two hits. It is, however, a little confusing that you can’t use the “Enforcer Takedown” skill – something that got me killed my first try. The main problem with this fight, however, is that it is preceded by a long monologue on the part of Iraq, livened up with only a couple of grunts for you to kill. In this fact, the game fails to follow one of the biggest rules for designing a fun video game – never, ever, under any circumstances, should you have an unskippable cutscene before a boss fight. It took me three tries to win, but having to listen to the cliché-ridden monologue every time nearly made me stop playing. </p>
<p>The final boss, long-running antagonist Damien Brenks, is, however, even worse. It is little more than a QTE to takedown one enemy, and then a slow-motion headshot – technically player-controlled, but really just set-up by the game, to kill the enemy who has been attacking Aiden and his family all the way through the game. Rather an anti-climax. While it could be argued that the part where you race around the city, constantly under attack by police and infrastructure hacking (all caused by Brenks) is the real final boss fight, making you take a boat all the way to a remote lighthouse only for a QTE to be your final payoff is rather disappointing. At the very least I was expecting a dramatic player-controlled gunfight, and was sorely let down in that regard. </p>
<p>Other minor issues include the inability to look directly up while driving or not aiming down sights, making dealing with helicopters far more annoying than it should be, poor camera angles while driving, and checkpoints often putting you in easier situations than you were actually in when reached them, for example resetting it so that enemies are unalerted. This is not really an issue, but it did feel like I was cheating the game when dying made parts easier than they otherwise would have been. Maybe the best solution to this is giving you the choice between the two, to make sure you can’t softlock your save.</p>
<p>Many people writing on Watch Dogs have complained about the Random Crime Intervention missions, but, personally, I think they are fine. It makes sense that, should you be noticed too soon, the criminal will bottle it and walk away, while Aiden wants the fight to start first, so he can enhance his reputation. </p>
<p>While almost everything written so far has been complaining about the game’s (many) flaws, I did enjoy my time with it, and do think that <em>Watch Dogs</em> is worth playing – otherwise why would I be writing a Diamond in the Rough about it? At the end of the day, while a lot of the elements attached to it are poorly thought out or badly implemented, the moment-to-moment gameplay of <em>Watch Dogs</em> is good enough to carry the title to the lofty heights of “quite good”. The, now standard, Ubisoft blend of stealth and action is on full display, and works very well, with gunning and stealth being equally viable, but, as it should be, a hybrid between the two best. The hacking serves well to enhance this, allowing scouting with cameras, environmental kills, and manipulation of cover, and so allows the player a more careful and tactical approach. 
The side missions are also very good. They are all, at least to some extent, unique, and almost always fun to play, as well as giving worthwhile rewards that genuinely help you to beat the main story, albeit many of these upgrades aren’t strictly necessary, at least on normal difficulty – I beat most of the game with a supressed pistol and the default assault rifle, both of which you acquire as part of missions, only buying a better assault rifle for the final few missions, and, much earlier, a grenade launcher, for AOE, enforcer, and vehicle kills. Any other weapons you need can be picked up off of enemies and kept for the rest of the game, and fast cars are unnecessary, making money not particularly useful. To be honest though, the grenade launcher, supressed pistol and default assault rifle are the only weapons you need, excepting a good shotgun for the Iraq bossfight. EXP, however, is far handier, with many skills being almost necessary/extremely useful. Enforcer Takedown and Helicopter Disruption allows you to far more easily deal with the game’s most difficult foes, while all of the craftable items are very useful. Frags and IEDs for tough enemies, ctOS scans to skip the camera scouting section of missions and blackouts to avoid the detections. Defensive Driver and other additional hacks are also very helpful, certainly more so than a slightly better weapon. Regardless of balance, unlocking new upgrades is always fun, and they are all useful to some extent, with the added hacks and consumables being the most enjoyable to get and use.</p>
<p>I don’t think I really need to explain why this game flopped critically on release. It was massively overhyped, and certainly has its flaws – I have nearly three thousand words on them right here. Nonetheless, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun enough to make the game worthwhile to play, and I look back on my experience with it as fun, albeit tinged with much frustration, and lack of a suitably epic finale. At the end of the day, its worth a play, just bear in mind that some things will get on your nerves, and that it is far from a masterpiece. Still fun though. </p>
